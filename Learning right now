prefix + z, enlarges/minimizes current pane

Learning Right Now:
f + char -> first instance of char on line 
m{char} -> leave a mark named {char}
'{char} -> jump to the line containing the mark named {char}
`{char} -> jump to the exact location of the mark named {char}
ctrl+y -> move up, preserving cursor position
ctrl+e -> move down, preserving cursor position
:e -> reload file


Good to know: 
* `:set paste` to fix pasting
* set clipboard=unnamed to allow pasting between vim instances
* :vs for vertical split. ctrl + w to move in split. ctrl + w then q to quit in vertical split.
* `gd` for go to first instance of word (e.g. function declaration)
* ctrl + r: redo undo
